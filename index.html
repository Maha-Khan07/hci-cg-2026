      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <img src="norman.jpg" alt="Portrait of Don Norman">

      <p>
        Don Norman is a pioneer in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), known for his work on
        user-centered design, usability, and cognitive engineering. He emphasizes designing
        systems that match human behavior and thinking, making technology intuitive and easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Norman has worked as a cognitive scientist, engineer, and usability consultant. He
        has held teaching and research positions at top universities, including the
        University of California, San Diego, Northwestern University, and the University of
        California, Berkeley.
      </p>

      <p>
        He authored several influential books, including "The Design of Everyday Things," which
        is widely considered a foundational text in design and usability. His work explores
        how everyday objects, software, and interfaces can be designed to reduce errors,
        increase efficiency, and improve user satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond academia, Norman has contributed to major technology companies as a consultant
        and design advocate. He has influenced how software, websites, consumer electronics,
        and even industrial products are developed to be human-centered.
      </p>

      <p>
        His insights continue to guide designers and engineers worldwide, emphasizing that
        good design is not just about aesthetics, but about understanding how humans think
        and interact with technology.
